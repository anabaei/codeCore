Things I learned 
* differencte between var i of array and var i in array, which the first one is index and second one iterate the value ðŸ˜˜
* In order to keep all columns with bootstrap same height, use flux to keep height of box fixed. It is like a container

* CSS select nth type of a class and the rest of that to use 
```css
.bud:nth-of-type(7) ~ .bud { color: black }
```
