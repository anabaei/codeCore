### Some notes
* Differencte between var i of array and var i in array, which the first one is index and second one iterate the value 
* In order to keep all columns with bootstrap same height, use flux to keep height of box fixed. It is like a container
```CSS
 #cell {

       height: 150px;
       border: 1px solid white;
       display: -webkit-flex; /* Safari */
       display: flex;
   }
```
* CSS select nth type of a class and the rest of that to use 
```css
.bud:nth-of-type(7) ~ .bud { color: black }
```
