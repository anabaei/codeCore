 # Steps

  npm install -g express-generator

 basic css we can write with scss and ejs we need  
  
   express --view ejs --css sass AwesomeAnswerExpress 

  we gonna use yarn instead of npm >>> i think
   yarn install 

we dont want commit node_modules folder
so we create file .gitignore and inside that we have:
node_modules/
.DS_Store


yarn install
yarn start


in favicon -- use the 

line 20 Body parser is use to request jason, and it takes json and convert to js object

line 23: there is indententsynatc so we change to 
line23 : we creaet a var instead of params inside it

var nodeSass = require('node-sass-middleware')

change all var to const.

line27: indentsyntax make it to false


/// in stylesheet the default is sass. 
// we rename it to scss to be able to write css and sass tofather 
after renaming the file just add {} after body and : after padding: font: etc..


inside gitignore add below , these dont need to commit and everytime they created from scss
git/stylesheet/*.css
