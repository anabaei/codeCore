  # has_many's first argument does not have to be another table name. It
  # can be a name of your choosing, but when doing so you must specify details
  # of the association. In this many to many association, we specify the
  # table in between with the `through:` argument and we specify
  # the associated model with `source:`.

  # The value given to `through:` must refer to the name of another association.
  # This association must be defined in the model before the `has_many ... :through`
  # many to many association. In this case, `has_many :liked_questions` must be defined
  # after `has_many :likes`.

  # has_secure_password is a built-in rails method that provides
  # use authentication features for the model its called in
  # 1. It will automatically add a presence validator for the password field
  # 2. It will create two virtual fields: password & password_confirmation
  # 3. When given a pasword, it will generate a salt. Then, it will hash the hash
  #    salt and password combo, store the result in the password_digest column
  #    (using `bcrypt`.)
  # 4. If you skip the `password_confirmation` field, then it won't give you
  #    a validation error for that, but if you provide it, it will validate that
  #    the `password` & `password_confirmation` are the same.
  # 5. The user instance gets the `authenticate` method which will allow
  #    us to verify if a user entered the correct password. It returns `false` if
  #    the password in incorrect and the user if correct.
