Node:
inside node :
process.env
to see the environment vars

Rails :


rvm rubies,  use rvm to manage rubies 
rvm use 2.4.1 

ruby gems always install on a system not like node modules which is with the application 
gems only install for specific ruby version, 

in irb type:   require ‘ruby gem’  
then all that gem is loaded in memory 

to test it we can have 
require ‘cowsay’
puts Cowsay.say(‘hello’, :cow)


cowsay : can be either class or module,   

:cow this one is a symbol 
puts "string".to_sym.class # Symbol  
puts :symbol.to_s.class    # String  

Symbols are unique address of a string which all point to one reference 

 Configuration Rails
