  # Note that we are not using `resources` in this case, because
  # there should always only be one session. Singular resource will
  # not create any routes that requires id. Instead, it expects that
  # it will always be working with the same resource.

  # Even though resource is singular and we gave an argument (i.e. :session)
  # that is singular, it still expects the controller to be named in plural
  # (i.e. SessionsController)
  resource :session, only: [:new, :create, :destroy]
  resources :users, only: [:new, :create]

  namespace :admin do 
    resources :dashboard, only: [:index]

   # do 
   #   reosurces :dashboard, only: :indext
   # end 
  # POST /questions/5/answers

  # resources :questions, except: [:delete]
  # resources :questions, only: [:index, :show
  resources :questions do
    resources :answers, only: [:create, :destroy]
    # We can nest routes. When doing so, rails will generate the route prefix
    # with the parent resources in this `/questions/:question_id`

    # Example routes that are generated by the above:
    # /questions/:question_id/answers(.:format)
    # /questions/:question_id/answers/new(.:format)

    # When using a route helper method of a nested route such
    # as question_answers_path (or question_answers_url), you
    # must provide an id or record of the parent resources
    # (e.g. `question_answers_path(@question)`)
  end
  # resources :questions will generate all CRUD routes just like
  # we wrote below for a given resource name. Make sure that you write
  # plural `resources` and also pluralize the resource name (i.e. :questions)

  # post('questions/', to: 'questions#create', as: :questions)
  # get('questions/new', to: 'questions#new', as: :new_question)
  # get('questions/:id', to: 'questions#show', as: :question)
  # get('questions/:id/edit', to: 'questions#edit', as: :edit_question)
  # patch('questions/:id', to: 'questions#update')
  # get('questions/', to: 'questions#index')
  # delete('questions/:id', to: 'questions#destroy')

  # The order of routes matter. The first route matches is the one that
  # is taken. Make sure that more specific appear before more broad routes
  # (e.g. `questions/new` should always appear before `questions/:id`)

  # this rules defines the following: when we recieve a `GET` request to `/`
  # which is the home page, send the request to the `Welcome` controller and
  # `index` action within that controller. An action is a public instance method
  # that is defined within the controller.
  # as: :home will generate a URL helper that will gives a view helper method
  # to auto-generate the URL
  get('/', { to: 'welcome#index', as: :home })

  get('/contact', { to: 'contact#new' })
  # get '/contact', { to: 'contact#new' }
  # get '/contact', to: 'contact#new'

  post('/contact_submit', { to: 'contact#create' })
end
