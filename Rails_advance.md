FactoryGirl.define do

  factory :user do
  // so we run it to generate a first name. In order to generate a value for first_name we have to put it inisde block

    // inside sequence method we tell which attribute we want to use, then we gonna pass a block that the block gets a numner as argument
    // so n would be 0,1,2,...

FactoryGirl.attributes_for :user 
//params is a just a hash. it uses when we test user create action, when we want to create 
// a user we have to send a params of the user and normaly these params comes from forms, but here

/// ---------------------------- no part ---------------------------- ///

define factories
then pass a block and pass variables to factory 
you may want to test a user as a model 

// on heroku only gems on production are run, and not on test and development
facotry_girl create model instances 

inside spec create another folder and call it factories

create factory fro users name, name user.rb 

// Ruby
// find the @ and replave it with -1@ 
e.gsub('@', '-1@')

after creating the factories folder and users.rb inside all in rspec then 
we run this in rails c
FactoryGirl.build(:user)

///
build is like new in here, 
///

// it gives attributes as user to create fake params 
FactoryGirl.attributes_for :user 
// if want to create a user they comes from 

// now create a compaigns controller 
now we go to rspec controller and write for actions

    end
// if routes were not mathes then we set them up 
// reouserces :compaignes, only: [:new, :create, :destroy]
// we should have new template and new action in controler

//Notice: all symbols in our app will be refered to the same one in our app. 
// symbols are like identifiers that identify things, symbols are values and not variables and never they gonna change

   // we could make it manual without needing Factory girl but to generic random data we use FG
      post :create, params: { campaign: FacotoryGirl.attributes_for(:campaign)}

// railg g model rspec:factories modelname

/// Factorygirl define compaign 

FactoryGirl.define do 
  factory :campaign do

   def user

   The pattern above is so common that RSPEC provides an helper

// It means before any request inside below scenario, user has to be initialized
// request.session helps to get session object inside our test and we gonna put our user id there
// in this way we create a user and puts it's id inisde session
