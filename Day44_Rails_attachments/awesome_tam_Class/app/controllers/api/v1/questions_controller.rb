    # an association. In this case, we eager load users that own a question
    # to display their full names in the json response.

    # When using jBuilder to server JSON, make sure that you do
    # not render with `render json: @question`. This would instead serialize
    # @question (transforming into json) and send that as a response.
    # Instead use render as you to send a template.
